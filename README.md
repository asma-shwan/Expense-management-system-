# Expense-management-system-

This project is an AI-based Expense Management System that leverages knowledge representation techniques like frames to manage categories, expenses, and budgets. Users can:

Add and track income

Set up expense categories with budget limits

Record and manage expenses by category

Visualize expenses using bar charts

Generate detailed budget reports

The system checks whether expenses stay within budget and provides warnings when they exceed the limit. Built with Python, it uses the matplotlib library for expense visualization.
